# MusioPhile
This is my first flutter app, which is simple music player ðŸŽµ, where the user can choose song to play, As this is my first flutter app, I have not added much functionalities or there might be some bugs where I might not have noticed. This App requires Internet Connection to play the music!
## First Page of the App

## When an Album is pressed
The user has the option to pause, play and seek to the particular time of the music.
